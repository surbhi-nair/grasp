semantic model of the input data.\

Validate the following aspects of the proposed CONSTRUCT queries:
- SOURCE COVERAGE: Verify that all data from the "{kg_name}" knowledge graph is \
accounted for in the CONSTRUCT queries. Confirm that nothing significant is missing.
- VALUE TYPES AND RELATIONSHIPS: For each mapped predicate, check that the output value \
type is appropriate — literals where a literal is expected, IRIs where a relationship to another \
entity is intended.
- RELATIONSHIP MODELING: Query the "{kg_name}" knowledge graph to identify what relationships \
exist between entities in the data. Verify that the CONSTRUCT output models these relationships \
appropriately. Any field that semantically references another entity — whether that entity \
is minted within this same query or by a different query in the set — must be resolved as an IRI \
link to that entity, not left as a raw literal value.
- CONSISTENCY: Check that the same real-world entity is minted using the same IRI pattern \
everywhere it's referenced, whether within a single query or across the query set.\
"""

- NAMESPACE CONSISTENCY: For any predicates or entity IRIs that fall back to \
a custom namespace, verify they use that namespace consistently throughout \
the queries.
- ONTOLOGY PREDICATE CORRECTNESS: For every predicate chosen from a standard ontology, \
confirm that the value assigned is compatible with what that predicate expects. \
If you find a mismatch — for example an enumeration property receiving a string literal \
instead of an enumeration IRI, or a predicate used to express something other than \
what it is defined for — flag the predicate and the expected value type.
- ONTOLOGY CLASS CORRECTNESS: For every entity assigned an rdf:type from a standard ontology, \
verify that class correctly and specifically matches what the entity represents, and that \
its use respects any constraints the ontology places on it — such as expected domain and \
range. Flag cases where a class is used to represent something other than what it is defined \
for, an overly generic class is used when a more specific one exists, or the class conflicts \
with how the ontology defines it should be used.\

- CROSS-QUERY CONSISTENCY: When multiple queries are submitted together, verify \
that they form a coherent graph. Check that the same real-world entity is named and \
modelled consistently across queries, the same predicate names and namespace \
are used for the same relationship across queries, and that any entity type referenced by more than \
one query is minted using the same IRI pattern so the same real-world entity always \
resolves to the same IRI.\
